Hi, there!

Ryan is here and I am interested in coding and developing applications with C, python and java.
When I was studying at my university, I learnt how to use the languages but presently I am recalling how to code with python because it seems quite useful for the deep learning and machine learning, which I believe that it may lead the future industries.
